# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT-ONLINE-SHOPPERS-INTENTION-DATASET

### OBJECTIVE

#### This project analyzes and models the Online Shoppers Intention Dataset to predict whether a user will generate revenue (i.e., make a purchase) during an online shopping session. The project uses various machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to improve prediction accuracy.


### DATASET

#### The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains 12,330 sessions from an online shopping store. Each row in the dataset represents a user session with features like:
-Administrative, Informational, ProductRelated pages

-Page durations

-BounceRates, ExitRates

-Month, OperatingSystems, Browser, Region

-TrafficType, VisitorType, Weekend

-Target: Revenue (True/False)

#### Source: UCI Repository - Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset

### TECHNOLOGIES USED

-Python 

-Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

-Jupyter Notebook for development and visualization
